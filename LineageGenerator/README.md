# Lineage Generator

This javascript-based tool allows you to quickly generate thousands of years of noble lineages for your fantasy kingdom. Various aristocratic houses are shown to intermarry and usurp eachother, and soverigns wage war with other kingdoms and build monuments to their honor. Simply open the included HTML page, specify your parameters, and click generate!

This is an evolving product and I would love to hear your suggestions and requests.
